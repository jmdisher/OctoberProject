# Entries here have the form:
# ID<TAB>capacity
#
# Missing values are assumed to be 0 or defaulted via some other logic internal to the implementation.
# (currently, this means they are given an "air" capacity if entities can collide with them)
# Note that the ID references are against item_registry.tablist but must appear in block_aspect.tablist to have meaning.
