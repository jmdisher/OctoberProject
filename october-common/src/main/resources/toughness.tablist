# Entries here have the form:
# ID<TAB>toughness
#
# Note that we assume only blocks are valid for consideration here, as the implementation will map any items which can't
# have block forms to a "not a block" value.
# Toughness is generally considered "number of milliseconds to break with no bonuses".
# Missing values are otherwise assumed to have a default "medium toughness" of 2000.
# To make a block unbreakable, set its toughness to 0.
# The maximum toughness value a block can have is 32000.
# Note that the ID references are against item_registry.tablist but must appear in block_aspect.tablist to have meaning.
