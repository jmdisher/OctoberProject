# Entries here have the form:
# ID[<TAB>allows_down]
#
# If "allows_down" is specified, this block can have a downward orientation.  Otherwise, it can only be flat.
#
# Anything not referenced here, which is a block, will always use the default "NORTH" orientation (ie: "none").
# Note that the ID references are against block_aspect.tablist.
