# Entries here have the form:
# ID<TAB>number
# 
# The given number is non-negative and represents the durability of the item (0 means unbreakable).  Durability is
# defined by the way the item is used, being different for things like tools, weapons, armour, etc:
# -tools:  The number of "uses" of the tool (one use per tick).
# -weapons:  The amount of "uses" of the weapon (one use per tick).
# -armour:  The amount of damage the piece absorbs instead of the target player.
# Note that every item listed here is non-stackable (which is why 0 is sometimes used).
