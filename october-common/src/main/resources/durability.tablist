# Entries here have the form:
# ID<TAB>number
# 
# The given number is non-negative and represents the durability of the item (0 means unbreakable).  Durability is
# defined by the way the item is used, being different for things like tools, weapons, armour, etc.
# Note that every item listed here is non-stackable (which is why 0 is sometimes used).
