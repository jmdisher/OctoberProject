# Entries here have the form:
# ID<TAB>base_type_id
# <TAB>can_spread<TAB>(true|false)
#
# All entries of ID type revert to base_type_id when covered by a block which can't breathe.
# If "can_spread" is true, this ground cover type will actively spread to nearby uncovered base_type_id blocks. 
#
# Note that the ID references are against block_aspect.tablist.
