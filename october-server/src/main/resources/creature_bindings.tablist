# Mappings used by the world generation when spawning creatures in the world.
# This may seem redundant, as the names imply the direct mapping type, but this allows a different block definition to
# fit into the same world generator without hard-coded assumptions of the creature IDs.  The names may become more
# abstract, in the future.
# They are all in the form: "VAR<TAB>creature_id"
